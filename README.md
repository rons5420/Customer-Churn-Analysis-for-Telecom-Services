# Customer Churn Analysis for Telecom Services

This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecom company to understand which customer segments are more likely to leave and why. Using Excel pivot tables, charts, and calculations, we break down trends by demographics, subscription plans, service usage, and more.

## ðŸ“Š Overview

The workbook includes:
- **Overview**: High-level churn rate, customer count, and breakdown by international plans.
- **Databel - Aggregate**: Aggregated data by state, age group, plan types, and churn outcomes.
- **Databel - Customer**: Detailed customer-level data including service usage, plan subscriptions, and churn labels.
- **Churn Analysis**: Churn rates broken down by age segments (e.g., Senior, Under 30).
- **Customer Pivots**: Pivot tables summarizing total customers, churned customers, and churn rates.

## ðŸ§  Key Insights
